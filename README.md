## Stone Skipping Simulation (MATLAB)

This project models the physical phenomenon of stone skipping on water using
classical mechanics and numerical simulation.

### Features
- 3D motion modeling under gravity, air drag, and water impact
- Numerical integration using RK4
- Time-series analysis of position and velocity
- Study of parameter influence on skipping behavior

This project was developed as an academic engineering simulation.
